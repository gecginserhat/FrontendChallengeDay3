Day 3: Advanced CSS Techniques - Taking Styling to the Next Level <br/>

🎯 Day 3 of my 21-day coding challenge, and today I delved deeper into CSS! 🌟 I tackled more advanced concepts and learned how to fine-tune my web designs.<br/>

🔍 Here's what I covered:<br/>

- Units & Fonts: Mastered CSS units, explored font-family, and experimented with various fonts.<br/>
- Icons: Learned how to integrate and style icons.<br/>
- Pseudo-Classes & Pseudo-Elements: Applied styles based on element states and used pseudo-elements for advanced styling.<br/>
- Nth-Child Selector: Targeted specific elements in a sequence with precision.<br/>
- Table Styling: Enhanced the look of tables with CSS.<br/>
- Overflow: Controlled content overflow and improved layout management.<br/>
- Positioning: Explored different position properties like absolute, relative, and fixed.<br/>
- Float: Used float to align elements and create flexible layouts.<br/>

🔥 CSS is more powerful than I imagined! Tomorrow, I’ll continue building on these skills.<br/>
